This is a simple business card type application that was created for Flutter House Event #1, at which I was a speaker.

The idea of this event was to demonstrate the basic functions of flutter, aimed at beginners and newcomers to flutter programming.

The app showed how to personalise details such as photo size, app background, text style and size. In addition, calling, texting and email functions were added. From within the app, it is possible to open social media links. These functions are made possible by the url_luncher package.
